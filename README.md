This app is based on the youtube api key that is unique to each user.
This video player contains two buttons in the start one for going directly to the video and one for going to the playlist.

This apps uses the custom youtube library from google and implements widgets dynamically rather than using the xml file. 



(This version doesn't contain the api key and the user should add its own api key in the java file of the video activity.)
